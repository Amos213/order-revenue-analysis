Analysis Project
      Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical SQL data analysis skills applied to real-world data. The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights from relational datasets using joins, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

The project includes:
Well-structured SQL queries
Screenshots of query execution and outputs
Clear logic for answering business questions

This repository is designed to show both technical SQL competence and analytical thinking, making it suitable for learning, academic submission, and portfolio use.

 Concepts & Techniques Used
1️ LEFT JOIN

Purpose: LEFT JOIN is used to combine data from two or more tables while retaining all records from the main (left) table, even when there is no matching record in the related table.

Why it was used in this project:

To ensure no important records were lost during analysis
To identify missing or unmatched data
To enrich datasets with additional attributes

Practical benefit: LEFT JOIN allows analysts to perform complete reporting and detect gaps in data, which is essential for accurate business decisions.

2️ Subqueries

Purpose: Subqueries are queries nested inside another query. They are used to break down complex problems into smaller, logical steps.
Why they were used in this project:
To filter data based on aggregated results
To perform conditional analysis
To improve query clarity and logical flow
Practical benefit: Subqueries help in solving advanced analytical questions such as identifying top-performing entities, comparisons, and threshold-based filtering.

3️⃣ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Purpose: CTEs provide a temporary named result set that makes complex SQL queries more readable, reusable, and easier to debug.
Why they were used in this project:
To simplify long and complex queries
To improve query readability
To organize multi-step data transformations
Practical benefit: CTEs are widely used in professional environments to create clean, maintainable SQL code suitable for collaboration and scaling.

 Screenshots & Query Evidence

This project includes screenshots that show:

SQL queries executed successfully
Output tables generated from joins and aggregations
Clear alignment between queries and results

 Project Usefulness
 For Data Analysts & BI Analysts
Demonstrates real-world SQL problem-solving
Shows correct usage of joins and query structuring
Useful for reporting and dashboard preparation

... Conclusion

This project highlights the effective use of LEFT JOINs, subqueries, and CTEs to analyze data in a structured and meaningful way. It demonstrates how SQL can be used not just to retrieve data, but to generate insights that support decision-making.

This repository serves as a strong foundation for advanced analytics projects and is suitable for professional and academic portfolios.
